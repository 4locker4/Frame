# Frame and registers

Here are two files named **Frame.asm** and **Regs.asm**

### Frame

It could show You a really pretty framed text. Actually You can create Your own frame, You just have to want to.

The command must be entered from the terminal, here are its arguments sequentially:

1. Lenght of frame
2. Hight of frame
3. Frame color
4. Text color
5. Number of frame (0 if You want to make Your own frame)
   - If You put 0, then in quotation marks (<"">) put 9 chars of Your frame.
6. Put in quotation marks (<"">) Your text. And in the end put <$> as end of string

*Congratulations!*

Press enter and enjoy!!!
